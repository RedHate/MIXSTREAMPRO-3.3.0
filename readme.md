	What it do?

		'globalKeySync' is a feature i made up that when enabled all the decks auto-sync the key. This isnt always useful,

		(MUST BE IN WAVEFORM VIEW TO MANIPULATE)
		To enable:  Shift + Browse Encoder
		To disable: Shift + Browse Encoder
		When pressing play, or any of the cue pads the key of the song will automatically sync to the playing track.
		You can then use the 'Browse Encoder' to pitch all decks in unison when the globalKeySync mode is active.

	Active Loops:
		To activate: While in 'Saved Loop' hold the pad of choice until the loop becomes striped.
		To deactivate: Repeate the above steps.

	-/+ buttons have been configured to control the parameters of all the different options of the "action pads"
